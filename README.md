## Introduction 
What‚Äôs Cookin‚Äô is an interactive website similar to NYTimes cooking or Allrecipes, where a user can browse recipes and save their favorites for later. Users can browse recipes by course or search for recipes by name or ingredient. If a photo or name catches their eye they can click on the recipe card and see more details about the recipe, such as ingredients, quantities, instructions and even an estimate of cost to make! On that full recipe page they also have the option to add it to their favorites and/or to their cooking queue. This app has TONS of search functionality built in‚Äî all of the search functionality available on the main page is also available on the users‚Äô favorites page (search by tag, name, or ingredient).

## Setup
1. This project fetches data from an API so you will need to begin by cloning down the API and running it.
2. Clone the API by running `git clone git@github.com:turingschool/What-s-cookin--starter-kit-API.git`
3. CD into that directory, run npm install and then npm start. You should see ‚ÄúWhat's cookin-starter-kit API is now running on http://localhost:3001 !‚Äù
4. Open a NEW terminal tab and cd somewhere *outside* of the API repo you just cloned. Do not close the tab that is running the API.
5. Clone a copy of this repo to your machine by running `git clone git@github.com:clairefields15/whats-cookin.git`
6. CD into the directory
7. Run `npm install`
8. Run `npm start`
9. A link will appear in the terminal similar to http://localhost:8080/ (you might see 8081). Open that link in your browser.
10. Enjoy!
